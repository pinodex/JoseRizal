  "He who does not love his own language is worse than an animal and smelly fish.",
  "It is a useless life that is not consecrated to a great ideal. It is like a stone wasted on the field without becoming a part of any edifice.",
  "While a people preserves its language; it preserves the marks of liberty.",
  "There can be no tyrants where there are no slaves.",
  "Ang hindi marunong lumingon sa pinangalingan ay hindi makakarating sa paroroonan.",
  "He who does not know how to look back at where he came from will never get to his destination.",
  "The youth is the hope of our future."
