>Mary, sweet peace, solace dear
>Of pained mortal ! You're the fount
>Whence emanates the stream of succor,
>That without cease our soil fructifies.
>
>From thy throne, from heaven high,
>Kindly hear my sorrowful cry!
>And may thy shining veil protect
>My voice that rises with rapid flight.
>
>Thou art my Mother, Mary, pure;
>Thou'll be the fortress of my life;
>Thou'll be my guide on this angry sea.
>If ferociously vice pursues me,
>If in my pains death harasses me,
>Help me, and drive away my woes!
