In this poem of love, Jose Rizal tries to express his feelings to Miss Consuelo Ortiga y Rey (C.O.y R.) through a dark and depressing tone and imagery, perhaps to bemoan a love that is not meant to be.

>Why ask for those unintellectual verses
>that once, insane with grief, I sang aghast?
>Or are you maybe throwing in my face
>my rank ingratitude, my bitter past?
>
>Why resurrect unhappy memories
>now when the heart awaits from love a sign,
>or call the night when day begins to smile,
>not knowing if another day will shine?
>
>You wish to learn the cause of this dejection
>delirium of despair that anguish wove?
>You wish to know the wherefore of such sorrows,
>and why, a young soul, I sing not of love?
>
>Oh, may you never know why! For the reason
>brings melancholy but may set you laughing.
>Down with my corpse into the grave shall go
>another corpse that's buried in my stuffing!
>
>Something impossible, ambition, madness,
>dreams of the soul, a passion and its throes
>Oh, drink the nectar that life has to offer
>and let the bitter dregs in peace repose!
>
>Again I feel the impenetrable shadows
>shrouding the soul with the thick veils of night:
>a mere bud only, not a lovely flower,
>because it's destitute of air and light
>
>Behold them: my poor verses, my damned brood
>and sorrow suckled each and every brat!
>Oh, they know well to what they owe their being,
>and maybe they themselves will tell you what.
