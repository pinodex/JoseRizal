>If truly a people dearly love
>The tongue to them by Heaven sent,
>They'll surely yearn for liberty
>Like a bird above in the firmament.
>
>Because by its language one can judge
>A town, a barrio, and kingdom;
>And like any other created thing
>Every human being loves his freedom.
>
>One who doesn't love his native tongue,
>Is worse than putrid fish and beast;
>And like a truly precious thing
>It therefore deserves to be cherished.
>
>The Tagalog language's akin to Latin,
>To English, Spanish, angelical tongue;
>For God who knows how to look after us
>This language He bestowed us upon.
>
>As others, our language is the same
>With alphabet and letters of its own,
>It was lost because a storm did destroy
>On the lake the bangka 1 in years bygone.
