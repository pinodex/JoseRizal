Rizal dedicated this poem to Josephine Bracken, an Irish woman who went to Dapitan accompanying a man seeking Rizal's services as an ophthalmologist.

>Josephine, Josephine
>Who to these shores have come
>Looking for a nest, a home,
>Like a wandering swallow;
>If your fate is taking you
>To Japan, China or Shanghai,
>Don't forget that on these shores
>A heart for you beats high.
