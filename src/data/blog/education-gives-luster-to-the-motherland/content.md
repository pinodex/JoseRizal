>Wise education, vital breath
>Inspires an enchanting virtue;
>She puts the Country in the lofty seat
>Of endless glory, of dazzling glow,
>And just as the gentle aura's puff
>Do brighten the perfumed flower's hue:
>So education with a wise, guiding hand,
>A benefactress, exalts the human band.
>
>Man's placid repose and earthly life
>To education he dedicates
>Because of her, art and science are born
>Man; and as from the high mount above
>The pure rivulet flows, undulates,
>So education beyond measure
>Gives the Country tranquility secure.
>
>Where wise education raises a throne
>Sprightly youth are invigorated,
>Who with firm stand error they subdue
>And with noble ideas are exalted;
>It breaks immortality's neck,
>Contemptible crime before it is halted:
>It humbles barbarous nations
>And it makes of savages champions.
>And like the spring that nourishes
>The plants, the bushes of the meads,
>She goes on spilling her placid wealth,
>And with kind eagerness she constantly feeds,
>The river banks through which she slips,
>And to beautiful nature all she concedes,
>So whoever procures education wise
>Until the height of honor may rise.
>
>From her lips the waters crystalline
>Gush forth without end, of divine virtue,
>And prudent doctrines of her faith
>The forces weak of evil subdue,
>That break apart like the whitish waves
>That lash upon the motionless shoreline:
>And to climb the heavenly ways the people
>Do learn with her noble example.
>
>In the wretched human beings' breast
>The living flame of good she lights
>The hands of criminal fierce she ties,
>And fill the faithful hearts with delights,
>Which seeks her secrets beneficent
>And in the love for the good her breast she incites,
>And it's th' education noble and pure
>Of human life the balsam sure.
>
>And like a rock that rises with pride
>In the middle of the turbulent waves
>When hurricane and fierce Notus roar
>She disregards their fury and raves,
>That weary of the horror great
>So frightened calmly off they stave;
>Such is one by wise education steered
>He holds the Country's reins unconquered.
>His achievements on sapphires are engraved;
>The Country pays him a thousand honors;
>For in the noble breasts of her sons
>Virtue transplanted luxuriant flow'rs;
>And in the love of good e'er disposed
>Will see the lords and governors
>The noble people with loyal venture
>Christian education always procure.
>
>And like the golden sun of the morn
>Whose rays resplendent shedding gold,
>And like fair aurora of gold and red
>She overspreads her colors bold;
>Such true education proudly gives
>The pleasure of virtue to young and old
>And she enlightens out Motherland dear
>As she offers endless glow and luster.
