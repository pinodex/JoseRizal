>When I recall the days
>That saw my childhood of yore
>Beside the verdant shore
>Of a murmuring lagoon;
>When I remember the sighs
>Of the breeze that on my brow
>Sweet and caressing did blow
>With coolness full of delight;
>
>When I look at the lily white
>Fills up with air violent
>And the stormy element
>On the sand doth meekly sleep;
>When sweet 'toxicating scent
>From the flowers I inhale
>Which at the dawn they exhale
>When at us it begins to peep;
>
>I sadly recall your face,
>Oh precious infancy,
>That a mother lovingly
>Did succeed to embellish.
>I remember a simple town;
>My cradle, joy and boon,
>Beside the cool lagoon
>The seat of all my wish.
>
>Oh, yes! With uncertain pace
>I trod your forest lands,
>And on your river banks
>A pleasant fun I found;
>At your rustic temple I prayed
>With a little boy's simple faith
>And your aura's flawless breath
>Filled my heart with joy profound.
>Saw I God in the grandeur
>Of your woods which for centuries stand;
>Never did I understand
>In your bosom what sorrows were;
>While I gazed on your azure sky
>Neither love nor tenderness
>Failed me, 'cause my happiness
>In the heart of nature rests there.
>
>Tender childhood, beautiful town,
>Rich fountain of happiness,
>Of harmonious melodies,
>That drive away my sorrow!
>Return thee to my heart,
>Bring back my gentle hours
>As do the birds when the flow'rs
>Would again begin to blow!
>But, alas, adieu! E'er watch
>For your peace, joy and repose,
>Genius of good who kindly dispose
>Of his blessings with amour;
>It's for thee my fervent pray'rs,
>It's for thee my constant desire
>Knowledge ever to acquire
>And may God keep your candour!
