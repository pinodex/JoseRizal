>To my Creator I sing
>Who did soothe me in my great loss;
>To the Merciful and Kind
>Who in my troubles gave me repose.
>
>Thou with that pow'r of thine
>Said: Live! And with life myself I found;
>And shelter gave me thou
>And a soul impelled to the good
>Like a compass whose point to the North is bound.
>
>Thou did make me descend
>From honorable home and respectable stock,
>And a homeland thou gavest me
>Without limit, fair and rich
>Though fortune and prudence it does lack.
