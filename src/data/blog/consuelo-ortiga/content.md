Consuelo Ortiga y Rey, the prettier of Don Pablo Ortigaâ€™s daughters, fell in love with him.

He dedicated to her _[A la Senorita C.O. y R.](/blog/a-la-senorita-consuelo-ortiga)_, which became one of his best poems. The Ortiga's residence in Madrid was frequented by Rizal and his compatriots.

He probably fell in love with her and Consuelo apparently asked him for romantic verses. He suddenly backed out before the relationship turned into a serious romance, because he wanted to remain loyal to Leonor Rivera and he did not want to destroy his friendship with Eduardo de Lete who was madly in love with Consuelo.
