Leonor Rivera, his sweetheart for 11 years played the greatest influence in keeping him from falling in love with other women during his travel.

Unfortunately, Leonor’s mother disapproved of her daughter’s relationship with Rizal, who was then a known filibustero.

She hid from Leonor all letters sent to her sweetheart. Leonor believing that Rizal had already forgotten her, sadly consented her to marry the Englishman Henry Kipping, her mother’s choice.
