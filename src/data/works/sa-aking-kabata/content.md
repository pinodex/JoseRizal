## Sa Aking Kabata

This is the work of Rizal when he was 8 years old, his message here is that we should love our own language. As he says “A person who loves his own language will surely strive for liberty”.

Telling everyone that our language, the tagalog language is equal to every other languages like English Spanish etc.
