## To The Filipino Youth

Rizal wanted to challenge the youth to study, to unleash the capacity of potential of every individual. Believing that “Kabataan ang Pag-Asa ng Bayan”.

That youth the fair hope of our motherland should be able to think and act independently, seek solutions from within themselves and not ask silly questions in a forum, for the betterment of the country.
